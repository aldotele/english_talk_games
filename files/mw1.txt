you find it useful when it is squared | usually you find it close to the square 
you must be quiet when you go there | you must be quiet when you use it
you have to cross it to see it | you will see a cross in it
it has some water that you cannot drink | it has some food that you cannot eat
one person will talk and others will listen | one person will listen to others talking
