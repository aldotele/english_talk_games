Each script is a different game that makes you practice english by 
playing with words, expressions, sentences.

The **files** folder contains several *txt* files with the information needed
to make each game work. You can recognize by the initials.\
For example, all files named *mw* refer to the *mystery word* game.

Just launch the game script and enter the name of the file you want to use for
the game, if asked.
