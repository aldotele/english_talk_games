# English Talk games
Each script is a different game that makes you practice english by 
playing with words, expressions, sentences.

The **files** folder contains several *txt* files with the information needed
to make each game work. You can recognize by the initials.\
For example, all files named *mw* are the input files for the *mystery word* game.

**How to play?**\
Just launch the game script and enter the name of the input file you want to use for
the game, if asked.
For example. if you want to play **mystery word**, first launch *mystery_word.py*,
then enter, for example, *mw2.txt* in order to retrieve the information from that file.

List of games:
- ***explain the word***: the purpose of the game is to randomly assign
english words to players, making each player explain the meaning of the word they have
been assigned, if they do know it, or to pass it to the next player, if they don't.

- ***mystery word***: this is an english version of a game called
[ghigliottina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1L_UhUCvo&ab_channel=Rai), 
which is the final step of the Italian Quiz Show "L'Eredit√†". The purpose of
the game is to find a word which ties 5 other words.

- ***guess the word***: the purpose of this game is to guess a word based on a description.
The words are related to specific themes, for example they might be companies or english professions,
depending on which input file is chosen.
